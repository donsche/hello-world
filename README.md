# hello-world
I will use this repository to store a collection of ideas, projects and resources.  
I was given a Raspberry Pi as a gift and am very excited about learning to use it for challenging projects.
PiClock and Weather Display:   https://hackaday.io/project/6184-piclock-a-raspberry-pi-clock-weather-display
Source can be found at https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock
Weather data comes from the underground weather api:  http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/ 
There's an overview, install guide and hardware guide along with the source on GitHub. https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock/blob/master/Documentation/Overview.md

So my bedside piclock now switches between day and night modes.
Previously it was continuously dimmed. Of course the project is on GitHub ( https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock ) and switcher.sh has been added. The Install instructions have been updated.

The full instruction set is included with the source on GitHub
https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock/blob/master/Documentation/Install.md
